/*  Example for the HYT939 temperature and humidity sensor used with the ESP8266 and ESP32
    Datasheet can be found here: https://www.farnell.com/datasheets/3627289.pdf

    Application
    This sensor is used in high demand humidity and temperature measurement applications. It provides high accurycy measurement with a ruggedized design.
